To start developing with PTT.ai-core, you need to have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed. Currently, only the latest stable version is tested.

### Check Go Version

You can check your installed go version with the following command:

```
$ go version
go version go1.12.4 darwin/amd64
```

### Install PTT.ai-core

We recommend **go module** as your dependency mangagement tool. You can start developing with PTT.ai-core without any setup with go module.
